## 2025-12-18: Developer Pain Points Analysis & Implementation Plan

**Changes**:
- Analyzed 9 developer pain points from market research
- Validated against codebase to assess current state
- Checked latest SDK versions (GA 7.10.6, MAX 8.x, Firebase 13.6.0, Adjust 5.5.0)
- Created comprehensive implementation plans in plan.md
- Prioritized GDPR/UMP as critical gap

**Pain Points Assessment**:
| # | Pain Point | Status | Priority |
|---|------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | SDK dependency conflicts | ✅ Addressed | - |
| 2 | Gradle/manifest merging | ⚠️ Partial | High |
| 3 | Multi-SDK overhead | ✅ Core value | - |
| 4 | Documentation quality | ✅ Improved | Medium |
| 5 | Unity version compat | ⚠️ Needs test | High |
| 6 | GDPR/ATT consent | ❌ Critical gap | **CRITICAL** |
| 7 | Testing without live | ⚠️ Partial | Medium |
| 8 | App size bloat | ❌ Not addressed | Medium |
| 9 | Update fatigue | ⚠️ Partial | Low |

**Learnings**:
- Google UMP deadline was Jan 2024 - we're behind on compliance
- Firebase 13.x available but 12.10.1 still fine (evaluate migration)
- GameAnalytics version is current (7.10.6)
- Adjust uses Git URL so auto-updates to latest

**Hindsight Insights**:
- **CRITICAL**: UMP integration is blocking for EU/UK ad revenue
- UMP API pattern: `Update()` → `LoadAndShowConsentFormIfRequired()` → `CanRequestAds()`
- AppLovin MAX automates UMP but we need explicit support for non-MAX users
- For Unity 6 testing: check Firebase 12.x compatibility first
- Build validation tool would catch many support issues preemptively

**Proposed API for UMP**:
```csharp
SorollaSDK.RequestConsentUpdate(callback);
SorollaSDK.ShowConsentFormIfRequired(onComplete);
SorollaSDK.CanRequestAds { get; }
SorollaSDK.ConsentStatus { get; }
```

**Sources Validated**:
- [AppLovin MAX Changelog](https://github.com/AppLovin/AppLovin-MAX-Unity-Plugin/releases)
- [GameAnalytics Releases](https://github.com/GameAnalytics/GA-SDK-UNITY/releases) - v7.10.6
- [Firebase Unity SDK](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-unity-sdk/releases) - v13.6.0
- [Adjust Unity SDK](https://github.com/adjust/unity_sdk/releases) - v5.5.0
- [Google UMP Unity](https://developers.google.com/admob/unity/privacy)

## 2025-12-17: ByteBrew Business Model Deep-Dive

**Changes**:
- Added ByteBrew funding details ($4M Seed, Konvoy Ventures)
- Documented "Land & Expand" business model strategy
- Added future monetization plans (paid UA tools, enterprise SLAs)
- Identified key competitive insight: data ownership differentiator

**Learnings**:
- ByteBrew is VC-funded ($4M from gaming-focused VCs)
- "100% free" is growth strategy, not sustainable business model
- Future paid products will be additive, not restrictive
- Their model: Slack/Figma playbook (free → indispensable → monetize/exit)

**Hindsight Insights**:
- **Sorolla's key differentiator vs ByteBrew**: You own your data
  - Sorolla wraps YOUR accounts (GA, MAX, Adjust)
  - ByteBrew owns the data layer = future lock-in risk
- ByteBrew validates free SDK market, but different trust model
- For positioning: emphasize "your accounts, your data, no middleman"
