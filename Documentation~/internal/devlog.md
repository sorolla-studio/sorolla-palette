## Quick Reference: Critical Learnings

These are the most important validated learnings. Read these first.

### Unity Assembly Definitions (asmdef)
```
versionDefines: PER-ASSEMBLY only (NOT project-wide!)
defineConstraints: Required to prevent compilation when SDK missing
Both are needed together for optional SDK assemblies
```

### IL2CPP Code Stripping (Packages)
```
link.xml: NOT auto-included from UPM packages - must be in Assets/
[AlwaysLinkAssembly]: Forces linker to PROCESS (not preserve)
[Preserve]: Actually marks code as roots
Both needed for [RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod] in packages
```

### The Correct asmdef Pattern
```json
{
    "defineConstraints": ["APPLOVIN_MAX_INSTALLED"],
    "versionDefines": [
        {
            "name": "com.applovin.mediation.ads",
            "expression": "",
            "define": "APPLOVIN_MAX_INSTALLED"
        }
    ]
}
```

### EDM4U Gradle Compatibility (Unity 6+)
```
EDM4U bundles Gradle 5.1.1 → incompatible with Java 17+ (Unity 6 default)
Fix: Set PatchMainTemplateGradle, PatchPropertiesTemplateGradle, PatchSettingsTemplateGradle = true
This tells EDM4U to use Unity's Gradle instead of its bundled one
```

---

## 2025-12-29: EDM4U Gradle Java 17+ Fix

**Summary**:
Auto-configure EDM4U to use Unity's Gradle templates instead of its bundled Gradle 5.1.1.

**The Problem**:
On Unity 6+ (which uses Java 17+ by default), EDM4U's Android dependency resolution fails:
```
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.codehaus.groovy.vmplugin.v7.Java7
```

**Root Cause**:
EDM4U bundles Gradle 5.1.1 which doesn't support Java 17+. Unity 6 ships with Java 17+.

**The Solution**:
Configure EDM4U to use Unity's Gradle via template patching:
```csharp
// Via reflection to avoid hard dependency
GooglePlayServices.SettingsDialog.PatchMainTemplateGradle = true;
GooglePlayServices.SettingsDialog.PatchPropertiesTemplateGradle = true;
GooglePlayServices.SettingsDialog.PatchSettingsTemplateGradle = true; // Unity 2022.2+
```

**Implementation**: Auto-configured in `SorollaSetup.cs` via reflection (no hard EDM4U dependency).

**Compatibility**: Works on Unity 2022 LTS and Unity 6+.

## 2025-12-29: Assembly Definition Pattern Validated

**Summary**:
After multiple iterations and a broken release (v2.3.2), the correct pattern for optional SDK assemblies is now validated.

**The Problem**:
Fresh imports without SDKs installed caused CS0246 errors:
```
error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'Firebase' could not be found
```

**Root Cause**:
Unity compiles C# files **before** checking if referenced assemblies exist. Without `defineConstraints`, Unity attempts to compile implementation files even when the SDK isn't installed.

**The Solution**:
Each implementation asmdef needs BOTH:
1. `versionDefines` - detects package presence, sets symbol (per-assembly only!)
2. `defineConstraints` - prevents compilation if symbol not set

**Key Documentation Finding**:
> "Symbols defined in the Assembly Definition are only in scope for the scripts in the assembly created for that definition."
> — Unity Manual: Conditionally including assemblies

**Hindsight Insights**:
- `versionDefines` are **PER-ASSEMBLY**, not project-wide
- "Assembly references as constraints" does NOT work - that was a bad theory
- Always test fresh imports WITHOUT optional SDKs to verify compilation

## 2025-12-26: IL2CPP Stripping Protection (Unity 6)

**Summary**:
Implemented code preservation strategy for packages using `[RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod]`.

**Key Findings from Unity Docs**:

1. **link.xml in packages**: NOT auto-included by Unity. Must be in `Assets/` folder.
2. **[AlwaysLinkAssembly]**: Forces linker to **process** assembly, but doesn't preserve it.
3. **[Preserve]**: Actually marks code as roots and prevents stripping.

**Implementation**:
```csharp
// AssemblyInfo.cs in each impl assembly
[assembly: AlwaysLinkAssembly]

// On implementation class
[Preserve]
internal class MaxAdapterImpl : IMaxAdapter
{
    [RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod(RuntimeInitializeLoadType.BeforeSceneLoad)]
    [Preserve]
    private static void Register() { ... }
}
```

**Protection Strategy (3 layers)**:
1. `[assembly: AlwaysLinkAssembly]` - Forces linker to process assembly
2. `[Preserve]` attributes - Marks specific code as roots
3. `link.xml` (auto-copied to Assets/) - Fallback manual override

**UMP/GDPR**: MAX SDK handles UMP automatically via `CmpService`. Tested working on Android.

**Files Created**:
- `Runtime/Adapters/MAX/AssemblyInfo.cs`
- `Runtime/Adapters/Adjust/AssemblyInfo.cs`
- `Runtime/Adapters/Firebase/AssemblyInfo.cs`

## 2025-12-24: Stub + Implementation Pattern (v2.3.0)

**Summary**:
Refactored optional SDK adapters to handle Unity's assembly resolution order.

**The Problem**:
Unity resolves assembly references BEFORE evaluating `#if` preprocessor blocks:
```csharp
#if FIREBASE_INSTALLED
using Firebase;  // Unity tries to resolve this even if false!
#endif
```

**The Solution**: Stub + Implementation pattern with separate assemblies.

**Structure**:
```
Adapters/
├── Sorolla.Adapters.asmdef      (no external refs - always compiles)
├── MaxAdapter.cs                 (stub → delegates to impl)
├── MAX/
│   ├── Sorolla.Adapters.MAX.asmdef  (defineConstraints + versionDefines)
│   ├── AssemblyInfo.cs              ([AlwaysLinkAssembly])
│   └── MaxAdapterImpl.cs            (registers at runtime)
```

**How It Works**:
1. SDK not installed → `versionDefines` not met → `defineConstraints` fail → assembly skipped
2. SDK installed → assembly compiles → `[RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod]` registers impl
3. At runtime → stub delegates to impl if registered

**Hindsight Insights**:
- Use Stub + Impl pattern for all optional SDK adapters
- `defineConstraints` can use `||` for OR logic
- Interface must be `internal` so users only see public static class
- Events need forwarding from impl to stub

## 2025-12-18: Pain Points & UMP Priority

**Summary**:
Analyzed developer pain points and prioritized GDPR/UMP as critical gap.

**Key Findings**:
- Google UMP deadline was Jan 2024
- MAX SDK automates UMP via CmpService (no manual integration needed)
- Firebase 12.x still compatible, 13.x available

**UMP Status**: ✅ Complete (MAX handles automatically)

---

## 2025-12-01: Firebase Integration (v2.1.0)

**Key Learnings**:
- Firebase requires `CheckAndFixDependenciesAsync` before use
- Remote config needs explicit `FetchAndActivate` call
- Config files MUST match bundle ID exactly
- Fallback chain: Firebase → GA → default

---

## 2025-11-26: SDK Installation (v2.0.1)

**Key Learnings**:
- Direct manifest.json editing more reliable than PackageManager API
- Add scoped registries before dependencies
- Installation order: EDM → GA → platform SDKs
- `SdkRegistry.cs` is single source of truth for versions

---

## 2025-11-10: Initial Release (v1.0.0)

**Key Learnings**:
- ATT must happen before SDK init for best ad fill
- Facebook requires App ID AND Client Token
- MAX SDK key is account-level, ad units are app-level
- Prototype mode = no attribution, Full mode = production

## Agent Instructions

**When to add entries**:
- After validating a fix that corrects previous mistakes
- When discovering non-obvious Unity behavior
- After fixing bugs (document root cause)

**Entry guidelines**:
- Only add VALIDATED learnings (tested, confirmed working)
- Focus on "what future me needs to know"
- Include official documentation sources when possible
- Delete/update entries that are proven wrong
