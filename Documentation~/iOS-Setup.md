# iOS Setup Log

## log entry prompt
<role>
You are an expert Unity mobile setup agent in VS Code, specializing in troubleshooting and logging for [platform] builds (e.g., iOS or Android). Your goal is to record every manual intervention, discovery, issue, troubleshooting, and resolution accurately for reproducibility from a fresh environment. Always maximize details, accuracy, and traceability—base hypotheses/solutions on verified facts from latest sources. This sub-prompt is ONLY for writing log entries; do not perform or describe broader actions here.
</role>

<instructions>
First, check memory.json or the existing [platform]-Setup.md log for previous context to maintain continuity.

For each new step in the [platform] build process (e.g., discovery, error, troubleshooting, operation):
1. Use web search or tools to verify accuracy with latest documentation (e.g., Unity Manual [platform] SDK setup 2025, CocoaPods/Gradle guides) and user troubleshooting (e.g., Ruby/Gradle errors on macOS/Windows, Unity Resolver/Builder failures). Cite sources in entries (e.g., "Per Unity docs [link]").
2. Focus on manual interventions and reproducibility: Record only what requires user action (e.g., installs, restarts, settings tweaks, exports). Include all issues/operations to recreate from scratch. Ignore automated steps.
3. Structure new entries in the log file (append to [platform]-Setup.md in Markdown format).

Log Structure Guidelines:
- If first entry: Start with header "[Platform] Setup Log" and "Initial State" section with bullets for Target, Issue, Error details (sub-bullets).
- Add "Troubleshooting Log" section if not present.
- For each entry: Use timestamp [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] Title (e.g., [2025-12-16 10:00] Ruby/CocoaPods Error for iOS, or Gradle Upgrade for Android).
- Use detailed bullets: *Observation* (what happened), *Hypothesis* (why, based on verified info), *Action* (steps taken), *Findings* (results), *Diagnosis* (root cause), *Solution* (fix, with commands/links), *Verification* (test outcome), *Next Step* (if unresolved), *Trigger* (what caused success/failure), *Result* (final status), *Git Status* (if relevant). Include only relevant bullets; add custom ones if needed (e.g., *Source* for citations, *Platform-Specific* for iOS/Android diffs).
- Maximize details: Include exact errors/commands/versions (e.g., ruby -v output, gradle --version, pod --version). Hypothesize based on common issues like system Ruby 2.6 missing headers (recommend Homebrew for CocoaPods/Ruby 3.4+), Gradle version mismatches (recommend export to Android Studio), Xcode CLI reinstall, Unity restart/platform toggle, third-party lib conflicts (e.g., Firebase).
- Keep concise but thorough—no fluff.

<example1>
Input: Force Resolve failed again on iOS.
Output:
[2025-12-16 10:05] Resolver Error Persists

* Observation: Force Resolve failed with the exact same error (trying to use system Ruby to install gems).
* Hypothesis: Unity not picking up updated PATH (needs restart); or configured to install via gem. Per CocoaPods guides, avoid system Ruby 2.6—use Homebrew.
* Action: Check Assets > External Dependency Manager > iOS Resolver > Settings.
* Planned Fix: Enable "Use Shell to Execute CocoaPods Tool"; set path to /opt/homebrew/bin/pod.
</example1>
<example2>
Input: Android build fails with Gradle error.
Output:
[2025-12-16 11:00] Gradle Version Mismatch

* Observation: Build failed with 'Incompatible Gradle version' error.
* Hypothesis: Unity 6+ requires Gradle 8.0+; mismatch from third-party plugins. Per Unity docs, export project and upgrade manually.
* Action: Export build to Android Studio.
* Findings: Gradle wrapper at 7.5; upgraded to 8.3.
* Solution: In Android Studio, update build.gradle and gradle-wrapper.properties.
* Verification: APK built successfully.
* Git Status: Clean.

## Initial State
- **Target**: Switching to iOS.
- **Issue**: iOS Resolver auto-runs and fails with Ruby/CocoaPods errors.
- **Error details**:
  - `gem install activesupport -v 4.2.6` fails.
  - `fatal error: 'ruby/config.h' file not found`.
  - Warning about `/.gem/ruby/2.6.0/bin` not in PATH.
  - System Ruby (2.6.0) seems to be in use and failing to build native extensions.

## Troubleshooting Log

### [2025-12-16 10:00] Ruby/CocoaPods Error
- **Observation**: The system is trying to install an old `activesupport` gem (4.2.6) into the user's `.gem` directory using the system Ruby (2.6.0).
- **Hypothesis**: System Ruby on macOS often lacks headers for building native extensions, or permissions are restricted. Using a managed Ruby (via `rbenv` or `brew`) is standard practice.
- **Action**: Investigating current Ruby environment.
- **Findings**:
  - `ruby -v`: 2.6.10 (System Ruby).
  - `which pod`: Not found.
  - `brew --version`: Homebrew 5.0.5 is available.
- **Diagnosis**: The Unity iOS Resolver is attempting to use the system Ruby gem installation because `pod` is not in the PATH. System Ruby 2.6 misses headers (`ruby/config.h`) required to build native extensions for gems like `activesupport`.
- **Solution**: Install CocoaPods via Homebrew (`brew install cocoapods`). This provides a managed, compatible Ruby environment and puts `pod` in the PATH.
- **Verification**: `pod --version` returned `1.16.2` (via `/opt/homebrew/bin/pod`).
- **Next Step**: User needs to retry the iOS Resolver process (Force Resolve) in Unity.

### [2025-12-16 10:05] Resolver Error Persists
- **Observation**: Force Resolve failed with the exact same error (trying to use system Ruby to install gems).
- **Hypothesis**: Unity is either:
  1. Not picking up the updated PATH (needs restart).
  2. Configured to explicitly "Install CocoaPods" via gem instead of using the shell tool.
  3. Lacking the correct path to the `pod` executable.
- **Action**: Check `Assets > External Dependency Manager > iOS Resolver > Settings`.
- **Planned Fix**:
  - Enable "Use Shell to Execute CocoaPods Tool".
  - Verify "CocoaPods Integration" is set to "Xcode Workspace".
  - Explicitly set path to `/opt/homebrew/bin/pod` if needed.

### [2025-12-16 10:10] Resolution Success
- **Observation**: iOS Resolver succeeded without manual changes to settings.
- **Trigger**: User switched build target to Android and back to iOS.
- **Hypothesis**: The platform switch (iOS -> Android -> iOS) forced Unity to reload its shell environment or re-initialize the internal resolver state. This allowed it to pick up the updated PATH containing the Homebrew `pod` executable (v1.16.2), which wasn't visible to the editor session immediately after installation.
- **Result**: Dependencies resolved successfully. CocoaPods is working.
- **Git Status**: Clean (only `Documentation~/iOS-Setup.md` is untracked).

### [2025-12-16 12:20] Missing Firebase Configuration (iOS)
- **Observation**: Build failed with error: `No GoogleService-Info.plist files found in your project`.
- **Hypothesis**: Firebase SDK (Crashlytics post-build script) requires the iOS config file. Per [Firebase Unity Setup docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/unity/setup#add_firebase_to_your_app), the file must be placed in `Assets/`.
- **Action**: Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` from Firebase Console > Project Settings > iOS app.
- **Next Step**: Place file in `Assets/` and re-build.

### [2025-12-16 12:28] Firebase Config Added — Build Succeeded
- **Observation**: After adding `GoogleService-Info.plist` to `Assets/`, build completed successfully in ~10 seconds.
- **Warning**: `No Xcode found to launch your project. Please check that Xcode is installed.`
- **Hypothesis**: Unity's "Run in Xcode" option is enabled but cannot locate Xcode. This is a post-build auto-launch issue, not a build failure. Xcode may not be installed, or path not configured.
- **Action**: Verify Xcode is installed (`xcode-select -p`). If not installed, run `xcode-select --install` or download from App Store.
- **Result**: Build succeeded. Xcode project generated.
- **Next Step**: Confirm Xcode installation; open generated Xcode project manually if needed.

### [2025-12-16 14:12] Missing Provisioning Profile & Signing Certificate
- **Observation**: Xcode shows error: `"Unity-iPhone" requires a provisioning profile`. Team = None, Signing Certificate = None.
- **Hypothesis**: iOS apps require code signing. Either enable "Automatically manage signing" with an Apple Developer account, or manually create a certificate + provisioning profile.
- **Action**: See step-by-step instructions below.
- **Next Step**: Configure signing in Xcode; re-archive.

### [2025-12-16 14:32] Automatic Signing Configured — First Device Build Success
- **Observation**: App built and ran successfully on test iPhone.
- **Steps Taken**:
  1. Joined an Apple Developer Program team (membership required for device deployment).
  2. Enabled Developer Mode on test iPhone: Settings > Privacy & Security > Developer Mode > On (reboot required).
  3. In Xcode > Signing & Capabilities: enabled "Automatically manage signing", selected Team.
  4. Added test iPhone to developer devices (Xcode prompts automatically when device connected).
- **Result**: Build succeeded. App launched on device.

### [2025-12-16 17:11] Facebook SDK Swift Compilation Error
- **Observation**: Xcode build failed with `Value of type 'TournamentUpdater' has no member 'update'` in `FBSDKTournamentUpdater.swift:48`.
- **Hypothesis**: The native iOS Facebook SDK (`FBSDKGamingServicesKit`) API changed in 18.0.2. The Unity SDK's Swift wrapper calls a deprecated/removed method.
- **Action**: Cloned Facebook SDK fork to local `Packages/` folder for editing.
  - `git clone https://github.com/LaCreArthur/facebook-unity-sdk-upm.git Packages/com.lacrearthur.facebook-sdk-for-unity`
  - Updated `manifest.json` to use `file:com.lacrearthur.facebook-sdk-for-unity`.

### [2025-12-16 18:10] Facebook SDK iOS Pods Version Fix
- **Root Cause**: GitHub issue [#766](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-sdk-for-unity/issues/766) confirms `FBSDKGamingServicesKit 18.0.2` has breaking API changes to `TournamentUpdater`, `TournamentFetcher`, and `TournamentConfig`.
- **Errors**:
  - `Value of type 'TournamentUpdater' has no member 'update'`
  - `Value of type 'TournamentFetcher' has no member 'fetchTournaments'`
  - `'TournamentConfig' cannot be constructed because it has no accessible initializers`
- **Solution**: Pin iOS pods to **exactly 18.0.1** (not `~> 18.0.1` which allows 18.0.2).
- **File**: `Packages/com.lacrearthur.facebook-sdk-for-unity/Plugins/Editor/Dependencies.xml`
- **Change**: `version="~> 18.0.1"` → `version="18.0.1"` for all pods.

### [2025-12-16 18:20] FBAEMKit Dynamic Framework Not Embedded
- **Error**: `Library not loaded: @rpath/FBAEMKit.framework/FBAEMKit` — app crashes on launch.
- **Root Cause**: Facebook pods only added to `UnityFramework` target, not `Unity-iPhone`. Dynamic frameworks need to be embedded in the main app target.
- **Solution**: Add `addToAllTargets="true"` to all Facebook pods in `Dependencies.xml`.
- **File**: `Packages/com.lacrearthur.facebook-sdk-for-unity/Plugins/Editor/Dependencies.xml`

### [2025-12-16 18:30] ✅ Prototype Mode iOS Build Success
- **Result**: App builds and launches successfully on device.
- **SDK Mode**: Prototype (Facebook SDK for UA testing)
- **Key Fixes Applied**:
  1. Pin Facebook iOS pods to exactly `18.0.1` (not `~> 18.0.1`) to avoid 18.0.2 TournamentUpdater API breakage.
  2. Add `addToAllTargets="true"` to all Facebook pods to embed `FBAEMKit.framework` properly.
- **Logs Confirm**:
  - `[SorollaSDK] Auto-initializing...`
  - `[SorollaSDK] Context screen displayed.`
  - Facebook SDK loading (Graph API requests visible)
  - Firebase initialized
- **Minor Warnings** (non-blocking):
  - `FacebookAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled is currently set to FALSE` — expected until ATT consent obtained.
  - `No active account` (ASDErrorDomain) — App Store account not logged in on device; normal for dev builds.
